# descicloapp-android

This is an old project that I had forgotten on my Google Drive account, an attempt to make an Android version of [DescicloApp](https://github.com/alefesouza/descicloapp-chrome), I'm putting it here just for historical purposes, I had created it in 05/2012, when I was 15 years old, two years before my first true Android application, [DroiDÃ©x](https://github.com/alefesouza/droidex).

I had decided to create it after heard about a beta Android application which can create other Android application, named [AIDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui), so I could use it to create my own apps because I didn't even had a computer at this time, just my own mobile phone (a Samsung Galaxy Ace 2011), I just went to lan houses when I needed use a computer.

At this time, I had absolutely no knowledge about Java or Android development or a programming teacher, probably I just got an Android sample application and started to modify it searching on Google/StackOverflow, just like how I learned JavaScript about two years before, for some reason I stopped its development, so there's nothing amazing in this code.
